    <h1>Welcome to Your New Project</h1>
    <p>I enjoyed Web Design much more than I thought I initially would. I signed up for this school
        specifically for the Game Design program. However, Web Design was a lot more fun than I thought.
        Learning HTML, CSS, and some Javascript was so helpful and so fun at the same time, you know? I must
        thank Mr Pierre for teaching not only me but the entire third period class about these coding websites and
        how to create and publish websites. It was easy!
    </p>
    <p> Sadly, the short month of Web Design must come to an end so we can learn even more technical stuff like
        Game Design and Computer Repair stuff! You know, seeing people that I watch on YouTube coding with Javascript and
        other launguages had me thinking "This must take years to learn!" In reality, it can take just a few weeks if you're 
        taught by the right teachers.
